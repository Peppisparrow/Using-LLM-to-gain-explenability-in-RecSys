         "Product Description In PART TWO of this incredible journey through the world of animatronics, the master of The Character Shop, Rick Lazzarini, not only builds upon the lessons he introduced in Part One, but also shares a host of additional mechanical techniques, as he continues with the construction of his lifelike puma. Here, Rick creates expressiveness in his animatronic creature by focusing on the movement of the jaw and the snarl of the lips. By the end, the range of emotion on display by the sum of these parts is truly amazing. WEBCOURSE HIGHLIGHTS Prepping & setting teeth into the vacuform skull Prepping & setting teeth into the vacuform skull Overview of cables, liners & housings Overview of cables, liners & housings Mounting & moving the jaw Mounting & moving the jaw Snarl of both the upper & lower lips Snarl of both the upper & lower lips Programming & troubleshooting ranges of motion Programming & troubleshooting ranges of motion About the Actor Rick makes creatures, animals, robots, and crazy things for a living. Steven Spielberg has called him a \"genius\". To his FACE! John Candy laughed at his jokes during the filming of SPACEBALLS, and Mel Brooks even cast him as both Pizza the Hut and a horseback riding chimp for the film's end sequence. Rick has thrown up on Charlie Sheen's boat. Guillermo Del Toro told him he makes the \"most realistic blood I've ever seen.\" Jim Cameron shared a banana with him once. In a limo. Rick brings the skills and technologies of prosthetics, animatronics and puppetry together to make a world of incredible beings. Rick's amazing work has been featured in such films as PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES, SNAKES ON A PLANE, WILLARD, BIG TROUBLE, MIMIC, DUDE, WHERE'S MY CAR, CASPER, OUTBREAK, THE SANTA CLAUSE, HOCUS POCUS, GHOSTBUSTERS II, SPACEBALLS and many more. He's known for creating the running Facehugger mechanism, and inner Queen Alien animatronics for the Oscar-Winning ALIENS while working for Stan Winston Studio. Few can match the quality or quantity of memorable, iconic creatures and characters he's created for major feature films, and hundreds of television commercials that are recognized worldwide, such as the Foster Farms Chickens, an animatronic Alligator for Verizon, and others. Lazzarini has built and puppeteered creations from a miniature six inch replica of Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell for HOOK, to life- sized elephants for OPERATION: DUMBO DROP, all the way up to a beautiful 20 foot tall marionette for Mayflower Moving. The menagerie of animatronic animals in residence at Lazzarini's Character Shop include a gigantic raven, scores of snakes, a realistic puma, a trio of hyenas, several chickens, a sheep, turtles, apes, rats, a chipmunk, a water buffalo, and two dolphins ready to take a road trip. He's created Buzzards, Frogs, Dogs, Aliens, Anteaters, Tortoises, Lobsters, and so many more for Commercial clients such as Ford, Chevy, Coca Cola, McDonald's, Cheerios, Budweiser, Sony, Duracell...and the list just goes on and on. Rick had an early love of comic books and apes, behind-the-scenes revelations about PLANET OF THE APES, making Super 8 Movies with ambitious yet adorably amateur effects, and being a super-geek. Combined with tenacity, persistence, and hard work (and even a little bit of talent) this developed into a life-long passion for animatronics and effects. A graduate of Loyola Marymount University, Rick got his start at prop houses and working at Makeup Effects Labs, John Dykstra's Apogee, Richard Edlund's Boss Films, and Stan Winston Studio. He opened up his own studio, The Character Shop, in 1986, and has been an industry leader from the start. Lazzarini can sculpt, make molds, research and develop in the lab, come up with incredible animatronic designs and mechanisms, and then bring his characters to life with virtuoso puppeteering skills. He is one of the top Creature Makers in Hollywood and he's always innovating, always looking for a new or more clever way to make something. Rick s forte is putting together great crews, then challenging himself and his crew to fulfill their potential. Under his tutelage, Rick's team is able to combine many disciplines to create incredibly lifelike and complex moving creatures. Rick is a man of honor who knows his stuff. He delivers the very best to his clients, on time and under budget. He has been a consultant to the medical community for which he was contracted to create lifelike surgical training models for Cedars Sinai. He is an excellent teacher, having taught courses at UCLA, AFI and USC. He heads his own Animatronics Institute, giving hands on lessons to eager students in animatronic creature design and creation. And he is honored to share his knowledge and expertise with you. About the Director ONLINE Special Effects Makeup and Creature Creation training by the world's finest artists and technicians.

         "This is one of the finest holiday films ever made.<br />Inspired by a story by Irving Berlin, the film features many wonderful Berlin holiday tunes, from &quot;White Christmas&quot; to &quot;Easter Parade&quot;. This is the film that introduced &quot;White Christmas&quot;, Bing Crosby's signature song (which was almost cut from the final version!).<br />Holiday hijinks ensue when Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby), decides that he's had enough of show business and chooses to retire to a farm in Connecticut. His pal and partner Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire) steals his gal Lyla at the last minute, so Jim takes up the life of a farmer on his own. Unfortunately for Jim, the farm life drives him nuts. He decides to turn the farm into an inn, where he can do entertainment shows for every holiday. The result is Holiday Inn, &quot;open holidays only&quot;.<br />Jim meets and falls in love with Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds), a fellow entertainer, and she helps out with the shows.<br />Things are looking up for Jim, but about this time, Ted's girl Lyla leaves him. Heartbroken (and crocked), Ted shows up at Holiday Inn on New Year's Eve and does a new dance number with Linda. It looks like he's found himself a new dance partner. Trouble is, he was so drunk, he can't remember who she is! Jim knows if Ted hooks up with Linda, he'll take her away from the Inn (and him!), so Jim begins some comedic conniving to keep Ted and Linda from meeting up. But poor Jim isn't out of the stewpot yet!<br />Walter Abel turns in a wonderful supporting perfomance as a scheming talent agent, and Irving Bacon is the quintissential New Englander as Gus the handyman. Fred does an inspired July Fourth dance routine, and Bing is in fine voice.<br />Holiday Inn has it all. Romance, laughter, crooning, catchy Irving Berlin tunes, and Bing and Fred at their best! We also get a sneak peek at the soundstage and set for Holiday Inn, as a Hollywood crew make a movie within the movie! A Christmas classic you're sure to love, not only at Christmastime, but at any time of the year.<br />If you need a lift, then come to Holiday Inn!"

This version does not attempt to clean up the legend of Robin Hood (as in some previous versions), but instead reveals it in all its down-and-dirtiness, especially when showing all the opression that Robin is fighting against.  If it could be released in its full length, this would be a must for any collection, but even in its shortened state it's well worth seeing.  END"

         "Any film directed by Orson Welles is engrossing and worth the time.  MACBETH is no exception.  For those of you familiar with the 1971 Roman Polanski version, Welles  brought to the screen a darker, more nightmarish world than Polanski could envision.  The lighting is stark and the shadows ominous.  Macbeth's madness increasingly pervades the atmosphere of the entire film, making the viewer unwilling to view this film with the lights out.  The restored version presents Welles's original conception; the actors speak their lines with authentic Scottish burrs (Welles was forced to redo the soundtrack by the studio brass).  A fascinating journey and imaginative interpretation of Shakespeare, Welles's MACBETH remains a major additon to American cinema and reveals the classical literary talents of one of the US's greatest visual artists.

         "If Leonardo diCaprio had not already made this film, he would be cast immediately for the role of lifetime. Mr. diCaprio's performance as the lanky, audacious, and attitude-heavy high school basketball player whose descent into heroin-hell is the true story of the author, Jim Carroll, can only be described as superb. As often as diCaprio is cited for his Titanic performance, &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; is one for his resume of fine, solid performances. With cameras in streets of lower Manhattan, the junkie life of a street urchin is neither fun nor games, it is pathos and crime. Teens who flock to diCaprio films should see &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; as a point of information. When the glamorous veneer of heroin and cocaine wears off, all that is left is the sight of diCaprio -- frothing at the mouth, twisting, and screaming in pain as the cold turkey rehabilitation program of friend, Ernie Hudson takes over his body. Most young girls, the rabid diCaprio fans, would find this scene too realistic and too ugly. But that is what the author intended. In a too brief cameo appearance, Carroll's words are at times glorious poems of haiku grace, but his own speed rap about his memories of a Catholic ceremony is a monologue chilling in its irony, for he is cooking up to fix while he speaks. Fine performances from the young supporting cast including a thuggish Marky Mark Walberg and a heart wrenching Lorraine Bracco as the mother who can do nothing for her son but call the police make &quot;Basketball Diaries&quot; worthy of everyone's attention.

Yet despite that, Flynn's portrayal of a jaded, world-weary -- but ultimately humorous and carefree -- Don Juan is a delight to watch. It was the last great swashbuckling film he would make, and the last in which any great care was taken by Warner Brothers to promote him as a major star.  END"

In &quot;Captain Blood,&quot; a 26-year-old Errol Flynn burst on the scene with drop-dead good looks, a knack for generating excitement, and one of the most powerful screen personas of any star in the history of film. This story of a doctor-turned-pirate is rousing entertainment from beginning to end, and represents a milestone for both Flynn and Warner Brothers. For Flynn, the movie made him an international star. For Warner Brothers, it gave them their first matinee idol and one of their biggest income-producers. &quot;Captain Blood&quot; also began the wonderful partnership of Flynn and Olivia DeHavilland, who would go on to make another six films together. NOTE: Beware of 99-minute versions of &quot;Captain Blood.&quot; At all costs, get the full, 119-minute version. It's like a whole different film.  END"

         "In real life, Errol Flynn was no pushover. Despite devastating good looks and a wickedly easygoing charm, he could hold his own in either a one-on-one fightfight or a barroom brawl. He was, in fact, one of the most feared fighters in Hollywood.<br />&quot;Gentleman Jim,&quot; the story of 19th century boxer James J. Corbett, gave Warner Brothers a chance to put their bad boy on display at his physical best -- exhibiting a lean, mean physique and an undeniable flair for ring work. His toothy grin, devil-may-care charm and boyish glee in a good fight all combined to make &quot;Gentleman Jim&quot; one of the 1940s' most compelling films, and one of Warner Brothers' biggest hits.<br />It is interesting to note that during the filming of &quot;Gentleman Jim,&quot; Flynn collapsed and was carted off to the hospital. He was diagnosed, at the ripe old age of 32, of having had a mild heart attack. His co-star in the film, Alexis Smith, visited him and begged him to slow down his destructive lifestyle. Flynn, she later said, flashed that beautiful smile of his and shook his head.<br />&quot;I enjoy this side of life,&quot; he told her, &quot;and don't care to see the other side.&quot;  END"

         "&quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade,&quot; which was released in 1936, was Errol Flynn's second starring role. Already an international sensation thanks to &quot;Captain Blood,&quot; Flynn shot to even higher levels of stardom with the release of this action-packed desert drama that co-starred Olivia DeHavilland.<br />Although the script is largely fictional -- Warner Brothers rarely let history stand in the way of a good story -- the film is exciting, beautifully photographed and well mounted. The final charge, in which Flynn leads the Light Brigade into the &quot;Valley of Death,&quot; is spine-tingling even to this day. Flynn is unbelievably handsome and dashing, DeHavilland is top notch as his love interest, and the entire cast makes &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; a joy to watch.<br />As an interesting note, co-star David Niven wrote in his autobiography &quot;The Moon's a Balloon&quot; of a fistfight between Flynn and a huge, brawny extra on the set of &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade.&quot; Flynn -- whom the extras thought was a spoiled pretty boy -- so severely thrashed the big extra that an ambulance came to take him to the hospital. After that, said Niven, Flynn was regarded with a newfound and healthy respect.  END"

         "&quot;The Edge of Darkness&quot; is one of the few movies made during World War II about World War II that holds up as more than just a propaganda piece. Warner Brothers pulled out all the stops with this intense and compelling drama about Norwegian villagers who rebel against their Nazi occupiers, giving the film a superior script, eye-popping camera work and a cast remarkable for its strength and versatility.<br />It may at first seem odd that Errol Flynn -- who gained stardom as the screen's premier swashbuckler -- was cast as a Norwegian fisherman/guerilla fighter. However, the wisdom of Warner Brothers in putting him in this role quickly becomes evident. His performance is restrained and believable, and he plays off the powerful ensemble cast with on-target accuracy.<br />&quot;The Edge of Darkness&quot; is a classic tale of good versus evil as only wartime Warner Brothers could have achieved it. The climactic uprising of villagers against their Nazi oppressors is enough to bring one to the edge of his seat and send chills of excitement dancing up his spine. This film is one of the best of its type, and shouldn't be missed.  END"

The other actors are sleep walking through the entire thing, probably regretting the fact that they were ever involved and  wanting to end their self-induced torture as quickly as possible.<br />If you  are brain damaged or a 14 year old acne faced female in love with L.  DiCaprio you will enjoy this film.  If you have enjoyed previous  adaptations of Alexander Dumas' Musketeer stories or can recognize bad  acting then you will be looking for a garbage can to throw up in (Better  get a bucket!).  If you paid money and saw this in the theatre without  violently demanding a refund afterwards, I admire your Olympian  self-restraint."
